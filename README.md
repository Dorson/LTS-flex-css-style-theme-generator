# Pricniples for the LTS Flex CSS Style Theme
In here there are basic rules and basic principles that make design desicions simple. Those principles can guide us to create the correct result, even if the future and technology will change. We can always go back to those simple principles, if in doubt.

+ 0.0 LTS stands for long term support.
We need this, because cities, hospitals, public services, and useful companies proivde digital services. If those services fial, then people lose income and users are frustrated. Functioning websites are the basic of our civilization.

+ 1. Flex = flexible and adaptable to any screen, website and app.

+ 2. Vertical design layout. From top to bottom :-)

+ 3. Global style and size settings first, then some expetions to overwrite global settings. We do set all the basic CSS style rules for the HTML elements at the top first. If we need, then we overwrite those global CSS style properties in exeptional and individual cases. If we need to then with a global CSS class. If we need to then on the individual page, where we need individual CSS style setting. No need to create all the possible syles and classes in the global style.css file.  It helps the browsers to paint websites faster !


+ 4. CSS Style properties are like functions and elements are their objects. No need to invent 100X CSS class names for all the possibel div boxes and exeption cases. The style settings are set in the reverse logic format. Instead of setting the style setting for all elements, we just treat the HTML elements as the properties of the CSS style.
 It's reverse logic. In short. The color or size owns the object in this theme :-)
  Example: img, bla, bla2, bla5, input, iframe, .box {margin: 3px; }


+ 5. Test and then test agian. A/B split testing of canges. We do test all CSS rule settings in an A/B test for usalibty, speed, browser compatiliblity, visibility, screen size flexibility on mobile, tablet, PC, TV, car screen, ebook readers, public kiosk service screens, etc..

+ 6. Optionalailty of the design elements. Delete the things you do not need. Keep the rest as you wish. Create your own version by reduction of the things you do not need. Which means that there are some elements, boxes or style rules that can be removed without breaking anything else.
